# Overview

## **It's non-official module yet. Just for alpha testing!**

`Magento_Baler` module introduces functionality to preload JS bundles configuration generated by https://github.com/magento/baler/ - tool for static analysis of Javascript dependencies.
This functionality is disabled by default and it can be enabled on the configuration page (Stores -> Configuration -> Advanced -> Developer -> Javascript Settings).
Developer settings is not displayed in production mode. To enable this feature in production mode, CLI command `bin/magento config:set dev/js/enable_baler_js_bundling 1` can be used.

### What is not implemented in this module yet:
1. The following features should be disabled when Magento_Baler is enabled:
   - JS Bundling
   - JS Minification
